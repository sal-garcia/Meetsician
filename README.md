in the future id like to perhaps add a few features including an api to help with the sign up process of looking for cities in states,
the ability for the user to update their account, and user authentication

A detailed set of instructions for getting started,
step 1: sign up
step 2: log in (no need for user authentication simply click log in)
step 3: look for musicians in whatever city you want(you should be able to find your own account)
